# xray-classification
A Tensorflow Fully connected neural network model using NIH Xray data for classification of thoracic diseases

Initial Draft demonstration using a softmax model to show steps for data preparation, tensorflow graph definition and prediction. 

Template can be used to build multi layer cnn + fc models
